# InsightsNet GitRepo Manager(igrm)


🚀 InsightsNet GitRepo Manager

Welcome to InsightsNet GitRepo Manager!
This tool (currently in beta) has been developed by the InsightsNet team at the Technical University of Darmstadt.

🎯 Purpose

The GitRepo Manager is designed to make Git more accessible to bachelor’s and master’s students, as well as anyone who wants to learn and use Git in their day-to-day projects. It enables users to integrate version control into their research workflow without:

risking damage to repositories, or

spending significant time learning command-line Git.

✨ Why Use It?

While Git on the command line remains the most powerful way to manage repositories, we understand that many beginners find the terminal intimidating — which often prevents them from fully adopting Git in their work.

The GitRepo Manager bridges this gap by providing:

- A user-friendly interface

- Access to essential Git functionalities

- A safe environment to learn and practice Git
